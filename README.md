# What is this?
This web application has no name, but it was built so web API experts could give their feedback on the GQM usability model I am (currently, as of September 2024) building with the guidance of my advisors (PhD Sandra Casas and PhD Gustavo Rossi).

# A GQM model?
The main goal of my research work is to help improve the usability of web APIs in general, since it is known to be a critical factor for their adoption. The GQM model I am building is meant for assessing certain aspects of a web API that can influence its usability. All metrics encompassed by the model were extracted from reliable sources, such as academic research papers and blogs/guides written by web API experts.
